# EmployeePortal
CRUD operations using ASP.Net core API, Entity Framework using .NET 8

EmployeePortal is a comprehensive ASP.NET Web API project built using .NET 8 and Entity Framework Core, designed to efficiently manage employee data. The project features the creation of robust and scalable RESTful APIs developed in C# and ASP.NET, adhering to industry best practices for API design.

For database management, I utilized Entity Framework Core with a code-first approach, enabling seamless integration with a SQL Server database. This approach facilitates smooth database migrations and schema updates, making it easier to manage the underlying database structure. The application supports all core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, providing essential endpoints to handle employee-related data efficiently.

This project highlights proficiency in .NET 8, C#, and Entity Framework Core, while demonstrating a deep understanding of modern software architecture, database management, and RESTful API development.
